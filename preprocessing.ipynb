I have no reason to believe that Klaang is stillalive but if what the Suliban woman told me is true, it's crucial thatwe try to find him. Computer, pause. Have you ever known aVulcan to return a favour? No, neither have I. Resume log. I stillhaven't decided whether to ask Sub-Commander T'Pol about this TemporalCold War. My instincts tell me not to trust her. Computer, pause. Archer to T'Pol. Report.\"],\n",
