LUKE,"... so i cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on deak's trail. i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments. as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad. uncle owen was pretty upset. he grounded me for the rest of the season. you should have been there... it was fantastic.

BIGGS,"you ought to take it a little easy luke. you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley, but those little skyhoppers are dangerous. keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall. [EOL]",look
LUKE,look who's talking. now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. you've gotten soft in the city... [EOL],i've

BIGGS,quiet down will ya! you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater! [EOL],i'm
LUKE,i'm sorry. i'm quiet. listen how quiet i am. you can barely hear me... [EOL],my
BIGGS,my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact. [EOL],around
LUKE,around forever trying to find them. [EOL],i
BIGGS,"i know it's a long shot, but if i don't find them i'll do what i can on my own... it's what we always talked about. luke, i'm not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service. the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side - the side i believe in. [EOL]",and
LUKE,and i'm stuck here... [EOL],i
BIGGS,i thought you were going to the academy next term. you'll get your chance to get off this rock. [EOL],not
LUKE,not likely! i had to cancel my application. there has been a lot of unrest among the sand people since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of anchorhead. [EOL],your
BIGGS,your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sand people with one blaster. [EOL],i
LUKE,"i know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. he needs me for just one more season. i can't leave him now. [EOL]",i
BIGGS,"i feel for you, luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. what good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the empire?... you know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the empire.

LUKE,it couldn't happen here. you said it yourself. the empire won't bother with this rock. [EOL],things
BIGGS,things always change. [EOL],i
LUKE,i wish i was going... are you going to be around long? [EOL],"no,"
BIGGS,"no, i'm leaving in the morning... [EOL]",then
LUKE,then i guess i won't see you. [EOL],maybe
BIGGS,maybe someday... i'll keep a lookout. [EOL],"well,"
LUKE,"well, i'll be at the academy next season... after that who knows. i won't be drafted into the imperial starfleet that's for sure... take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend i've got. [EOL]",so

OWEN,i have no need for a protocol droid. [EOL],sir
THREEPIO,sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why i've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... [EOL],what
OWEN,what i really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators. [EOL],vaporators!
THREEPIO,vaporators! sir - my first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators. you could say... [EOL],do
OWEN,do you speak bocce? [EOL],of
THREEPIO,"of course i can, sir. it's like a second language for me... i'm as fluent in bocce... [EOL]",all

LUKE,uncle owen... [EOL],yeah?

LUKE,this r2 unit has a bad motivator. look! [EOL],"hey,"
OWEN,"hey, what're you trying to push on us? [EOL]",excuse
THREEPIO,"excuse me, sir, but that r2 unit is in prime condition. a real bargain. [EOL]",what
LUKE,what about that one? [EOL],what
OWEN,what about that blue one? we'll take that one. [EOL],"yeah,"
LUKE,"yeah, take it away. [EOL]","uh,"
THREEPIO,"uh, i'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. he really is in first-class condition. i've worked with him before. here he comes. [EOL]","okay,"

LUKE,"it just isn't fair. oh, biggs is right. i'm never gonna get out of here! [EOL]",is
THREEPIO,is there anything i might do to help? [EOL],"well,"
LUKE,"well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! [EOL]",i
THREEPIO,"i don't think so, sir. i'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. not on this planet, anyways. as a matter of fact, i'm not even sure which planet i'm on. [EOL]","well,"
LUKE,"well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. [EOL]",i

LUKE,hello. [EOL],you
LUKE,you got a lot of carbon scoring here. it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. [EOL],with
THREEPIO,"with all we've been through, sometimes i'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the rebellion and all. [EOL]",you
LUKE,you know of the rebellion against the empire? [EOL],that's
THREEPIO,"that's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir. [EOL]",have
LUKE,have you been in many battles? [EOL],"several,"
THREEPIO,"several, i think. actually, there's not much to tell. i'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. well, not at making them interesting, anyways. [EOL]","well,"
LUKE,"well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. were you on a starcruiser or... [EOL]",help
LEIA,"help me, obi-wan kenobi. you'remy only hope. [EOL]",what's
LUKE,what's this? [EOL],what
THREEPIO,what is what?!? he asked you a question...what is that? [EOL],help
LEIA,"help me, obi-wan kenobi. you're my only hope. help me, obi-wan kenobi. you're my only hope. [EOL]","oh,"
THREEPIO,"oh, he says it's nothing, sir. merely a malfunction. old data. pay it no mind. [EOL]",who
LUKE,who is she? she's beautiful. [EOL],i'm
THREEPIO,"i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir. [EOL]",help
LEIA,"help me, obi-wan kenobi... [EOL]",i
THREEPIO,"i think she was a passenger on our last voyage. a person of some importance, sir - i believe. our captain was attached to... [EOL]",is
LUKE,is there more to this recording? [EOL],behave
THREEPIO,"behave yourself, artoo. you're going to get us in trouble. it's all right, you can trust him. he's our new master. [EOL]",he
THREEPIO,"he says he's the property of obi-wan kenobi, a resident of these parts. and it's a private message for him. quite frankly, sir, i don't know what he's talking about. our last master was captain antilles, but with what we've been through, this little r2 unit has become a bit eccentric. [EOL]",obi-wan
LUKE,obi-wan kenobi? i wonder if he means old ben kenobi? [EOL],i
THREEPIO,"i beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? [EOL]","well,"
LUKE,"well, i don't know anyone named obi-wan, but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea. he's kind of a strange old hermit. [EOL]",i
LUKE,i wonder who she is. it sounds like she's in trouble. i'd better play back the whole thing. [EOL],he
THREEPIO,"he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. he suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. [EOL]",h'm?
LUKE,"h'm? oh, yeah, well, i guess you're too small to run away on me if i take this off! okay. [EOL]",there
LUKE,there you go. [EOL],"well,"
LUKE,"well, wait a minute. where'd she go? bring her back! play back the entire message. [EOL]",been
THREEPIO,been playing. the one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! [EOL],luke?
AUNT BERU,luke? luke! come to dinner! [EOL],all
LUKE,"all right, i'll be right there, aunt beru. [EOL]",i'm
THREEPIO,"i'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. [EOL]","well,"
LUKE,"well, see what you can do with him. i'll be right back. [EOL]",just
THREEPIO,just you reconsider playing that message for him. [EOL],"no,"
THREEPIO,"no, i don't think he likes you at all. [EOL]","no,"
THREEPIO,"no, i don't like you either. [EOL]",you
LUKE,"you know, i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen. [EOL]",what
OWEN,what makes you think that? [EOL],"well,"
LUKE,"well, i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him. he says he belongs to someone called obi-wan kenobi. [EOL]",i
LUKE,"i thought he might have meant ben. do you know what he's talking about? well, i wonder if he's related to ben. [EOL]",that
OWEN,that old man's just a crazy wizard. tomorrow i want you to take that r2 unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed. that'll be the end of it. it belongs to us now. [EOL],but
LUKE,but what if this obi-wan comes looking for him? [EOL],he
OWEN,"he won't, i don't think he exists any more. he died about the same time as your father. [EOL]",he
LUKE,he knew my father? [EOL],i
OWEN,i told you to forget it. your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers. [EOL],"yes,"
LUKE,"yes, sir. i think those new droids are going to work out fine. in fact, i, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. and if these new droids do work out, i want to transmit my application to the academy this year. [EOL]",you
OWEN,you mean the next semester before harvest? [EOL],"sure,"
LUKE,"sure, there're more than enough droids. [EOL]",harvest
OWEN,harvest is when i need you the most. only one more season. this year we'll make enough on the harvest so i'll be able to hire some more hands. and then you can go to the academy next year. [EOL],you
OWEN,"you must understand i need you here, luke. [EOL]",but
LUKE,but it's a whole 'nother year. [EOL],"look,"
OWEN,"look, it's only one more season. [EOL]","yeah,"
LUKE,"yeah, that's what you said last year when biggs and tank left. [EOL]",it
LUKE,it looks like i'm going nowhere. i have to finish cleaning those droids. [EOL],"owen,"
AUNT BERU,"owen, he can't stay here forever. most of his friends have gone. it means so much to him. [EOL]",i'll
OWEN,i'll make it up to him next year. i promise. [EOL],luke's
AUNT BERU,"luke's just not a farmer, owen. he has too much of his father in him. [EOL]",that's
OWEN,that's what i'm afraid of. [EOL],what
LUKE,what are you doing hiding there? [EOL],it
THREEPIO,"it wasn't my fault, sir. please don't deactivate me. i told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission. [EOL]","oh,"
LUKE,"oh, no! [EOL]",that
THREEPIO,that r2 unit has always been a problem. these astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. even i can't understand their logic at times. [EOL],how
LUKE,how could i be so stupid? he's nowhere in sight. blast it! [EOL],pardon
THREEPIO,"pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? [EOL]",it's
LUKE,it's too dangerous with all the sand people around. we'll have to wait until morning. [EOL],"luke,"
OWEN,"luke, i'm shutting the power down for the night. [EOL]",all
LUKE,"all right, i'll be there in a few minutes. boy, am i gonna get it. [EOL]",you
LUKE,you know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. [EOL],"oh,"

OWEN,luke? luke? luke? where could he be loafing now! [EOL],have
OWEN,have you seen luke this morning? [EOL],he
AUNT BERU,"he said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. [EOL]",uh?
OWEN,uh? did he take those two new droids with him? [EOL],i
AUNT BERU,i think so. [EOL],"well,"
OWEN,"well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay! [EOL]",how's
LUKE,how's that. [EOL],old
LUKE,"old ben kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but i don't see how that r2 unit could have come this far. we must have missed him. uncle owen isn't going to take this very well. [EOL]","sir,"
THREEPIO,"sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault. [EOL]",sure.
LUKE,sure. he needs you. he'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so... [EOL],deactivate!
THREEPIO,"deactivate! well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt... [EOL]","wait,"
LUKE,"wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. it looks like our droid... hit the accelerator. [EOL]","hey,"
LUKE,"hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? [EOL]",master
THREEPIO,"master luke here is your rightful owner. we'll have no more of this obi-wan kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either. you're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. [EOL]","well,"
LUKE,"well, come on. it's getting late. i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up. [EOL]",if
THREEPIO,"if you don't mind my saying so, sir, i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop. [EOL]","no,"

LUKE,what's wrong with him now? [EOL],oh

BEN,"the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. tell me, young luke, what brings you out this far? [EOL]","oh,"
LUKE,"oh, this little droid! i think he's searching for his former master... i've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him. he claims to be the property of an obi-wan kenobi. is he a relative of yours? do you know who he's talking about? [EOL]",obi-wan
BEN,obi-wan kenobi... obi-wan? now thats a name i haven't heard in a long time... a long time. [EOL],i

LUKE,then the droid does belong to you. [EOL],don't
BEN,don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. very interesting... [EOL],i

THREEPIO,where am i? i must have taken a bad step... [EOL],can
LUKE,can you stand? we've got to get out of here before the sand people return. [EOL],i
THREEPIO,"i don't think i can make it. you go on, master luke. there's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. i'm done for. [EOL]","no,"
LUKE,"no, you're not. what kind of talk is that? [EOL]","quickly,"
BEN,"quickly, son... they're on the move. [EOL]","no,"
LUKE,"no, my father didn't fight in the wars. he was a navigator on a spice freighter. [EOL]",that's
BEN,that's what your uncle told you. he didn't hold with your father's ideals. thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. [EOL],you
LUKE,you fought in the clone wars? [EOL],"yes,"
BEN,"yes, i was once a jedi knight the same as your father. [EOL]",i
LUKE,i wish i'd known him. [EOL],he
BEN,"he was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. i understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. and he was a good friend. which reminds me... [EOL]",i
BEN,"i have something here for you. your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. he feared you might follow old obi-wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. [EOL]","sir,"
THREEPIO,"sir, if you'll not be needing me, i'll close down for awhile. [EOL]","sure,"
LUKE,"sure, go ahead. [EOL]",what
LUKE,what is it? [EOL],your
BEN,your fathers lightsaber. this is the weapon of a jedi knight. not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. [EOL],an
BEN,"an elegant weapon for a morecivilized time. for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic. before the dark times, before the empire. [EOL]",how
LUKE,how did my father die? [EOL],a
BEN,"a young jedi named darth vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights. he betrayed and murdered your father. now the jedi are all but extinct. vader was seduced by the dark side of the force. [EOL]",the
LUKE,the force? [EOL],"well,"
BEN,"well, the force is what gives the jedi his power. it's an energy field created by all living things. it surrounds us and penetrates us. it binds the galaxy together. [EOL]","now,"
BEN,"now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. and where you come from. [EOL]",i

BEN,i seem to have found it. [EOL],general
LEIA,"general kenobi, years ago you served my father in the clone wars. now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire. i regret that i am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and i'm afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed. i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r2 unit. my father will know how to retrieve it. you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan. this is our most desperate hour. help me, obi-wan kenobi, you're my only hope.

BEN,"luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. [EOL]",i
BEN,"i don't blame you for being angry. if i was wrong in what i did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. you see, what happened to your father was my fault. [EOL]",anakin
BEN,anakin was a good friend. [EOL],when
BEN,"when i first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him. i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi. i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda. i was wrong. my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy. [EOL]",there's
LUKE,there's still good in him. [EOL],i

BEN,you cannot escape your destiny. [EOL],i
LUKE,i tried to stop him once. i couldn't do it. [EOL],vader

LUKE,but i had to help my friends. [EOL],and
BEN,"and did you help them? it was they who had to save you. you achieved little by rushing back prematurely, i fear. [EOL]",i
LUKE,i found out darth vader was my father. [EOL],to
BEN,"to be a jedi, luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. you're no longer so reckless now, luke. you are strong and patient. and now, you must face darth vader again! [EOL]",i
LUKE,i can't kill my own father. [EOL],then
BEN,then the emperor has already won. you were our only hope. [EOL],yoda
LUKE,yoda spoke of another. [EOL],the
BEN,the other he spoke of is your twin sister. [EOL],but
LUKE,but i have no sister. [EOL],hmm.
BEN,"hmm. to protect you both from the emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. the emperor knew, as i did, if anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. [EOL]",leia!
LUKE,leia! leia's my sister. [EOL],your
BEN,"your insight serves you well. bury your feelings deep down, luke. they do you credit. but they could be made to serve the emperor. [EOL]",when
BEN,"when your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. your mother and i knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine... and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa, on alderaan. [EOL]",the
BEN,"the organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. but it was a title without real power, since alderaan had long been a democracy. even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. that's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire. and because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause. that's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine, if her troubles became desperate. [EOL]",but
LUKE,"but you can't let her get involved now, ben. vader will destroy her. [EOL]",she
BEN,"she hasn't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have, luke ... but the force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. there is no avoiding the battle. you must face and destroy vader! [EOL]","well,"
